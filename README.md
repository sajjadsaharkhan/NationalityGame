# NationalityGame
my first JavaScript game ðŸ˜…

# Game Story: 
A white screen with 4 boxes on the 4 corners of the screen.

Each box will have a text on it reading ""Japanese"", ""Chinese"", ""Korean"" and ""Thai"".

From the middle top of the screen, the photo of a person should drop and slowly go to the bottom of the screen within 3 seconds.

As the image is dropping down, the user should guess the nationality of the person before it reaches the bottom, and throw it towards one of the 4 nationality boxes by panning it (for about 20px or more). The photo should then animate towards that box and slowly fade out.

If the user guessed correctly, it will be a positive 20 points. If it was wrong it will be -5 points.

The total points should be displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Immediately after the picture has disappeared, the next picture should drop.

This should continue for 10 or more pictures and then the game will stop, showing the user's total score, with a button to play again.
